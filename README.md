Flow of the Project
Developer can run this project through two way
1. By STS only (backend & frontend)
2. By STS (backend) and Visual Studio Code(frontend)

1. By STS only (backend & frontend)

Need to confirm first the static folder should be downloaded properly and be there in (GuestBookApp\src\main\resources\static).


If yes, then only we can run through this way , if static folder not downloaded then using second way (By STS (backend) and Visual Studio Code(frontend)
) we can run this project.

We can run it in STS using right click on 
GuestBookAppApplication and click on run as java application.


If run successfully then use the mention url (http://localhost:8080) to check the application


2. By STS (backend) and Visual Studio Code(frontend)


Need to ensure both backend and frontend code have been checked out from git.

To run backend, we must follow previously mention. 

To run frontend separately must open the checked-out folder in visual studio code by open folder option in file menu.

Run ng serve command in terminal.
Or NPM start command in terminal.


If run properly without any issue use the URL (http://localhost:4200)
